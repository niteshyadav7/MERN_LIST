# MERN CRUD Operations Project

Welcome to the MERN CRUD Operations Project! This full-stack application demonstrates the basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.

## Features

- *CRUD Operations:* Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on data entities, showcasing the fundamental interactions with the backend API.

- *User-Friendly Interface:* Utilize React components and state management to create an intuitive user interface for managing data.

- *Dynamic Data Rendering:* Implement dynamic rendering of data to provide real-time updates and a seamless user experience.

- *Form Validation:* Validate user input in forms to ensure data accuracy and integrity.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, Redux (State Management), HTML, CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js (API Development), MongoDB (Database)
- Deployment: Heroku (Frontend), Heroku or AWS (Backend)

## Installation


1. Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/niteshyadav7/shopping_here

2. Install frontend dependencies and start the React app:

* cd frontend
* npm install
* npm start

3. Install backend dependencies and start the Express server:
  
* cd backend
* npm install
* npm start
  
4. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and add your JWT secret and email credentials:

JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
EMAIL_USERNAME=your_email_username
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password

5. Access the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- Explore the frontend to interact with the CRUD functionalities and manage data entities.

## Future Enhancements
